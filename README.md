# FoodDelivery-clone
Mobile application built with react native, redux, tailwind css and sanity.
It's an application for food delivery but only the user side, restaurant's and deliverer's side are not implemented inside.
All restaurant's names, logos and images used inside the app are used for educational purposes only, no orders are actually being made and no payments are being made
by the user.

## Running FoodDelivery-clone
1. Install expo, then run `expo start`
2. If you feel the need to make some changes to some restaurants or menus, install sanity and start a local server cause that's how the data is being fethced inside the app
3. install sanity and run `cd sanity` then run `sanity start` to start the local server.
