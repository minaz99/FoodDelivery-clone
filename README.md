#FoodDelivery-clone
Mobile application built with react native, redux, tailwind css and sanity.
It's a food delivery application that concerns the user side, deliverer's and restaurant's mobile app are not there, no payment is actually being made inside
Restaurant's names, logos and images used inside the mobile application are all for educational purposes, no real orders are being placed and no money is being paid by a user.

#To Run FoodDelivery-clone

1. You need to install expo then you run `expo start`
2. If you feel the need to change the restaurant or menus being used you could start your own local saniy server, from which we are fetching all the data,
you need to install sanity first then run `cd sanity` after that `sanity start`.
